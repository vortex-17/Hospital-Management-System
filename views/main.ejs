            Stroke has always been a much feared medical emergency, and rightly so, someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds, and someone dies of a stroke every four minutes. Not all strokes are preventable, so it is very important to recognize
            the early 6 signs of stroke and get treatment rapidly. Stroke damages brain tissue, but that loss can be minimized by getting quickly to an emergency room that can connect to a rapid response stroke center.
